                <p class="pe-3 fs-md">Asset Management is explicitly focused on helping organizations to achieve their defined objectives and to determine the optimal blend of activities based on these objectives.</p>
                <p class="pe-3 fs-md">An important part of this system is asset management planning including deciding related policy, strategic asset management plan, asset management objectives, and short-term asset management plans. In addition to these aspects, asset management decision making, and risk management are two essential functions needed to successfully manage physical assets functions.</p>
                <p class="pe-3 fs-md">The above areas constitute a framework for maintenance, reliability, and asset management.</p>
                <p class="pe-3 fs-md">Dexterity provides its consultancy services for building such systems and framework. This Framework has been designed to assist people who manage organization’s assets to adopt best practices for asset management. These processes may vary to accommodate individual circumstances, but in each instance the objective is to achieve the best use of our organization’s assets.</p>
