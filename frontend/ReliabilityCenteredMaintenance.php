                <p class="pe-3 fs-md">Reliability-centered maintenance is “A process used to determine the maintenance
                    requirements of any physical asset in its operating context” (John Moubray, Reliability-Centered
                    Maintenance, second edition). The phrase was coined more than forty years ago to describe a cost
                    effective way of maintaining complex systems. It uses the answers to seven very basic questions to
                    help determine the best maintenance tasks to implement in an Equipment Maintenance Plan (EMP). RCM
                    is well-proven technique to enhance reliability and safety, and to optimize the overall maintenance
                    activities performed on site in a cost effective and applicable timeframe.</p>
                <p class="pe-3 fs-md">And Preventive Maintenance Optimization, PMO is a structured process aimed at
                    preserving and restoring the equipment condition. With PMO, we focus on identification of the
                    failures (failure modes) and develop PM tasks to manage the failure. It is a process to improve the
                    effectiveness and efficiency of the PM process. Effective PMs address and reduce the consequence of
                    specific, probable failure modes. Efficient PMs are value-added tasks conducted using the least
                    labor, downtime, and materials required to complete the task.</p>

                    amount of work that provide value to organizations and balances between cost and risk</p>
