                    identifies that a well-structured necessary level of asset management capability has been
                    established and existed. This level is enough to prove that the organization is competent enough and
                    implemented related requirements of asset management. But going further and beyond the
                    implementation of these basic requirements can be offered to optimize this implementation toward
