                <p class="pe-3 fs-md">The purpose of Criticality Analysis is to identify systems and equipment items
                    whose failure is likely to have the greatest impact on plant integrity, operational performance and
                    maintenance costs. The objectives of this analysis include quantifying the likely losses to which
                    plants and facilities may be exposed through equipment failure and identifying and prioritizing
                    improvement areas where organizations may subsequently secure business benefits.
                    Prioritization of system and equipment criticality is based on the business consequences of failure
                    including safety, environmental, repair cost , quality and production losses.
                    <br><br>Criticality Analysis is a base for Maintenance & Reliability Management. It facilitates and
                    adds value to many Asset Management areas and decisions. Some examples of these areas are:
