                <p class="pe-3 fs-md">An Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) system allows organizations to address the
                    complete life cycle management of their assets: from capital planning to procurement, installation,
                    operations, compliance reporting, maintenance, repair, and ultimately decommissioning. But just like
                    any large-scale technology transformation, EAM system implementations must be carefully planned,
                    managed, executed, and measured for organizations to fully achieve their intended results.</p>
                <p class="pe-3 fs-md">As a very important step required for Enterprise Asset Management Systems (EAMs)
                    and Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS), data preparation and implementation is
                    crucial for the success of such implementations.</p>
                <p class="pe-3 fs-md">Having complete, correct, relevant, quality and well organized data needs big
                    effort and experienced personnel.</p>
                <p class="pe-3 fs-md">At Dexterity, we help clients at data collection and migration activities of their
                    EAM system implementation journey. With our practical functional expertise and technological global
                    background, we have learned how best to transform organizations in different industries and
                    countries.</p>
                <p class="pe-3 fs-md">These services include:</p>

                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p class="pe-3 fs-md">EAM system implementation is a multi-year journey and just like all time-intensive initiatives, is at higher risk for failure. But by understanding the transformation steps, expectations and quality implementation, organizations can be better prepared to handle the challenges along the way and achieve their intended results.
